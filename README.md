Steps to Create Project.

1. Initiate Git Hub Repo
2. Add Readme file describing the project.
3. Install dependencies: express, pug, mongoose.
4. Generate a package.json
5. Edit the package.json such that the start script refers to nodemon.
6. Add a .gitignore file to ignore the node_modules folder.
7. Create the first end point so that we can display the API.
8. Use express to create a server listening to port 3000.
    HINT: Requires GET and LISTEN methods.
9. Create a module for the root directory.
    HINT: requires importing and exporting.
10. Introduce Pug 
    HINT: requires middleware and 'views' folder.
11. Create a file to which all pug files refer to
    HINT: layout.pug and extends
12. Refer to a CSS file in PUG.
    HINT: express method, public folder and a use method...

    OPTIONAL: ADDING BOOTSTRAP.
        1. Copy-paste the stylesheet <link> into your <head> before all other stylesheets to load our CSS. [Link provided by bootstrap website.]
        
        NOTE: use HTML TO PUG converter to make this process faster.

        2. You can install bootstrap examples into the pug file.
